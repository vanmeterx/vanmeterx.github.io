                  <h2>Hera</h2>
                  <p>
                    Wife to Zeus, Hera would inevitably torture women. Like some wives, Hera blamed the women for their husband’s infidelity (admittedly, it was kind of tough to punish the king of the universe for anything), even if they had tried to refuse Zeus’ amorous advances. Hera turned them into monsters, banned them from giving birth on land, tricked Zeus into murdering them and more — any children resulting were not spared either, as Hercules learned when Hera tried to kill him for his entire life, starting when he was a baby. Of course, she wasn’t much better with her own kids; when she gave birth to the ugly Hephaestus, <strong>she threw the baby off a mountain.</strong>
