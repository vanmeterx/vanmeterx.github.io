          <h2>Cronus</h2>

            <p>
              Cronus, son of Uranus, was the leader and youngest of the first generation of Titans.  In Athens, the Greek held a festival called Kronia in honor of Cronus to celebrate the harvest.  Cronus is typically depicted with a sickle which many associate with the harvest and the Golden Age, but that association of the sickle would be incorrect!

                  <h3>The Castrator</h3>

                    <p>
                      Cronus was the envious type, a hater, if you will.  He envied the power of his father, who was the ruler of the universe.  Cronus' mother, Gaia, created a sickle made of stone, wanting one of their children to castrate Uranus for hiding her two youngest children.

                    <p>
                    Cronus, being the douche that he was, was willing to do the deed.  He ambushed Uranus after being lured to meet with Gaia.  He castrated Uranus and threw his man parts into the sea.
                    </p>
                  <h3>The Captor</h3>

                    <p>
                      After having neutered his own father, Cronus decided he wasn't done.  He again chose to capture and hold his youngest siblings against their will, much to the dismay of Gaia.  He held them captive with the dragon, Kampe, guarding them to prevent any escape plans his younger siblings may have had.
                    </p>
                  <h3>The Cannibal</h3>

                    <p>
                      As he grew older, Cronus learned from Uranus and Gaia that it was his destiny to be overthrown by his sons, just as Cronus had done to Uranus.  To prevent the prophecy, he decided to eat his children as soon as they were born.  That's right.  Ate them.
